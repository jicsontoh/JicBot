# JicBot

## Basic Overview
Built a basic telegram bot to explore the telegram bot API and learn to deploy the program through a Docker container in a cloud environment. 
Also integrated a MongoDB database to keep track of the messages exchanged. Will add more features in time to come!

## Version 1.0 - Telegram Bot
